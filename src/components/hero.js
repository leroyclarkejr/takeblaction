          Take Blaction is a collective group invested in making lasting,
          positive and impactful change. We've created a collective working to
          define the term,{" "}
          <strong>
            Blact (verb): to act with the intent of benefitting Black Lives.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this collective is to compile resources for Black racial
          and social justice into one place so that anyone can easily access and
          navigate all of the databanks, resources, and links to black justice
          materials.
