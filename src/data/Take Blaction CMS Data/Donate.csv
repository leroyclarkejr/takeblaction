The shooting has now left my son critically injured as he fights for his life. The extent of my son’s injuries is unknown, but we remain prayerful as he continues to undergo multiple rounds of operations to save his life. This fund is established to cover my son’s medical expenses, mental and grief counseling for our family and to assist our family in the days to come, as we continue to seek justice for Jacob. A portion of these proceeds will also be used to benefit my son’s six children, some of whom witnessed this horrific act of violence.

It is one part of a multi-racial, cross-class movement centering the leadership of people of color.Therefore, SURJ believes in resourcing organizing led by people of color, and maintaining strong accountability relationships with organizers and communities of color as central part of our theory of change.SURJ believes that we must ground our organizing in a framework of “mutual interest” -- white supremacy is integral to economic injustice, to maintaining patriarchy and other forms of oppression. Racism and white supremacy keep the many divided for the benefit of the few. We must have an inclusive, open-hearted approach to organizing, calling people into this work rather than creating barriers to participation while maintaining a clear political line. When those of us who are white realize that racial justice is core to our liberation as well, then masses of white people will withdraw support from white supremacy. Together, as part of a powerful multi-racial, cross-class movement for collective liberation we can force the system of white supremacy to crumble.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edfdc4615dbd34ff38974f4/5ee580361829abe9b344f043_Showing%20up%20for%20racial%20justice.jpg,Donate
