A Transparent Investigation Into the Death of Eric D Lurry Jr.,a-transparent-investigation-into-the-death-of-eric-d-lurry-jr,5edfdd6646dbd61f3a2c243a,5f11fe9fb9a3dc5fe6745feb,Fri Jul 17 2020 19:40:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Fri Jul 17 2020 19:40:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Fri Jul 17 2020 19:40:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Petition,https://www.change.org/p/illlinois-governor-a-transparent-investigation-into-the-death-of-eric-d-lurry-jr?recruiter=195780471&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=sms&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_abi&utm_term=psf_combo_share_initial&recruited_by_id=6e8ef6d4-2238-42ef-8173-996aef165a8c,Sign the petition for a transparent and fair investigation around the the death of Eric D. Lurry Jr.,"<p>On June 30, 2020, CBS aired a news report at 10pm that confirmed the Mayor of Joliet, Bob O’Dekirk, acknowledged that there were witnesses and a video tape of what transpired while Eric D. Lurry Jr. was in custody. The Joliet Police Department released the video tape after five months passed and it clearly shows misconduct. In addition to the news broadcasting, there have been multiple stories on what happened on January 28, 2020 leading up to his death. While I am fully aware that law enforcement has a job to do, and they often have to make split second judgement calls; the information that has been shared clearly indicate that the judgment calls made during the arrest were very excessive and dehumanizing.</p><p>The job of law enforcement is to protect and serve all citizens, even those who may have a criminal past. There is no reason for anyone to die in police custody, that is why laws were put into place to determine if a person is innocent or guilty. The untimely death of my cousin has had a profound impact on our entire family and the Joliet community. His family and other members of the community have been left scared, confused, angry, sad, and heartbroken that we are among the unfortunate list of families left looking for answers in a senseless loss. I urge you to lend us your support in getting a full and transparent investigation to try to bring closure to our family. I know many are saying that all lives matter and that is true; however, all lives cannot matter until black lives are included in all lives.<br>‍</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>MeShona Mitchell</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edfdc4615dbd34ff38974f4/5f11fc7d10de385bfa0a9b05_download.png,

DJ was a football player &amp; junior at Pace University. He was celebrating at a sports bar with his teammates when some others got in a fight. DJ was parked outside the building in a fire lane out front when he was asked to move. DJ complied and moved out of the spot when Aaron Hess shot him, took him out of his car, handcuffed him and laid him on the ground and left him there to die. Aaron Hess was not charged with any crime and was named Officer of the Year later on in the year. Hess deliberately killed DJ. DJ was a bright student with a bright future and he deserved better than this.

At that time, George McMichael and Travis McMichael observed Arbery jogging and they confronted him with guns. &nbsp;However, when Arbery tried to defend himself from one of the gun wielding white men, he was savagely shot and killed by the man and his son.Please sign the attached petition. We will forward this petition, along with a letter of support to the bill's authors.Furthermore, call Governor Brian Kamp @ 404-656-1776 and Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan @ 404-656-5030 to voice your support for HB 426. </p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edfdc4615dbd34ff38974f4/5ee38bf3d6081e3e579ac98a_petitions_change.jpeg,change.org

The price of empathy-driven training is a fraction of the cost of settlement and, most importantly, human life. We must prevent history from repeating itself again.Nationwide riots and protests have captured national attention, but we must use that momentum to create lasting change through legislation. Once this petition gains 2,000 signatures, it will be presented to local members of Congress in hopes of introducing a bill calling for mandated police de-escalation training.

We have called on the Minneapolis City Council to become these visionary leaders by pledging to defund the Minneapolis Police Department and invest in the resources that really keep us safe and healthy, especially in Black communities, Indigenous communities and communities of color. We have called on them to commit to the following by Saturday, May 30th at 8am:1. To never again vote to increase police funding or to increase the police department's budget. 2. To propose and vote for a $45 million cut from MPD's budget as the City responds to projected COVID-19 shortfalls. 3. To protect and expand current investment in community-led health and safety strategies, instead of investing in police.4. To do everything in my power to compel MPD and all law enforcement agencies to immediately cease enacting violence on community members.

If two black men pulled up next to a white jogger and shoot him dead they would most likely get the death sentence in Georgia. This is a hate crime. This is clear white prejudice and injustice working in America, and I will not stand for it and I hope you will not either.

We feel his decision to sit on the case of Ahmaud Arbery's murder for three months was out of prejudice/racism and a personal relationship with the murderers.We need to feel like there is JUSTICE in the justice system and not based on racism, prejudice, or personal feelings. Mr. Barnhill displayed a clear case of not being able to disconnect himself from this case and look at the clear cut facts involved.Also we are very aware that Mr McMichael was a police officer who worked CLOSLEY with the district attorney's office up until last year. How many murders has Mr. Barnhill covered up against minorities using the ""self defense and citizens arrest statute""?We the people do not feel justice can be served appropriately with a prosecutor like Mr Barnhill receiving these cases and sweeping them under the rug without even PRESENTING them properly. We feel he is operating based on his own personal agenda. He should not get to decide whether or not our sons, brothers, or fathers even DESERVE justice before their stories get their day in court.Also we ask that all other cases that have crossed his desk be looked over again by a non bias party.

This whole incident makes me sick. The power that comes with the PD is old news. It's 2020 and we still have racist police officers murdering innocent civilians. This is bull sh*t. I don't care if the officer were to be red, blue, yellow, black, or purple. The man murdered another human being for no reason. He was getting some sick satisfaction of crushing this man's neck. He sat there crushing his neck cutting off his air passages. The man started bleeding from his nose before going unconscious. The Police Department remained completely unphased by it. One officer checked his pulse after the man went unconscious. At this point the man was gone. He was murdered for what reason? This was no medical condition. And even If the man had any medical condition whatsoever he would still be alive today had this officer not spent over 15 minutes crushing his throat. The man was NOT fighting back at this point. Everything was under control. Yet the officer continued using excessive force. I ask the you [we] the people stand up to the Minneapolis Police Department. Both officers are to be charged with murder and to be sentenced to the highest possible amount of time in Federal prison. Enough is enough!!! No more white privileges. No more police privileges.
